Refer to the [context for the project](https://github.com/madelyn-redick/computing_in_context_resources/blob/main/Computing%20in%20Context%20Resources.pdf).

At the time of requesting these resources from schools, the CIC defined computing in context in 2 ways:
- integrating different disciplines or domains into computing curriculum (e.g., applying computing techniques to topics in the Humanities discipline), and/or 
- regularly updating curriculum and assignments to cover topics relevant to todayâ€™s students (e.g., analyzing Twitter data to evaluate algorithmic bias in an election year).

The CIC is building a page on their website that organizes the resources and their components to make creating computing in context courses easier. In order to  maintain this resource, the CIC needs to own copies of the resources. This repository contains scripts to achieve this depending on the file type of the original resource.
